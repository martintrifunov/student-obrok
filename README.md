## Setup Guide

### Configuring ENV variables:

Make sure to read the ENV_TEMPLATES.md

### Using docker (recommended):

Clone the project. <br>

Run the commands:
```bash
#This will download and preprocess routing data for the map
./init-route-data.sh
#For development or production
./init.sh dev|prod
```

### Without using docker (not recommended):

Clone the project. <br>

Setup a MongoDB database. <br>

You can find what ENVs you need in each of the docker compose files. <br>

Run the commands:
```bash
#This will download and preprocess routing data for the map
./init-route-data.sh
#Install dependencies for the client & server
cd src/client
npm install
cd ..
cd server
npm install
#CD into the client directory & run Vite
cd ..
cd client
npm run dev
#CD into the server directory & run nodemon
cd ..
cd server
npm run server
```

### Configuring a self renewing SLL for HTTPS:

```bash
#Make sure your prod env is running in the background and that you have cron installed & running
./init.sh prod

#Find the Absolute Path
cd /var/docker
pwd

#Verify the path
ls /var/docker/docker-compose-prod.yml

#Set Up the Cron Job to renew cert every 60 days at 5 am
crontab -e
